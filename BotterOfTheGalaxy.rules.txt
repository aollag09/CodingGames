 	Rules
The game is played on a map 1920 units wide and 750 units high with 2 players.
The coordinate X=0, Y=0 is the top left pixel.

Each player controls a hero of their choice, which they pick before the game begins by outputting each hero’s name.

The teams start out on opposite sides of the road stretching along the map.

An allied tower is placed for each team next to their starting position. Each player must protect their own tower, while trying to destroy their opponent's tower.

Every 15 turns a wave of allied units spawns for each player next to their tower, to aid them in battle against their opponent. These units will head straight for the enemy tower, but will stop to fight any enemy they encounter in their path.

Round types

There are two different types of turns in this game.

The first one is for hero picks and occurs at the beginning of the game. When the input variable roundType is negative, you must output the name of the hero you want to play. If you output WAIT  instead of a hero name, a hero will be selected for you.

The second type of turn is a normal game turn where you have to fight your way towards the win conditions. roundType will be positive and its value will represent the amount of heroes that you have to order.


Game Entities: Units / Heroes / Towers / Neutral Creatures

Every entity has the following attributes:
unitId
team - the team they belong to
type - it can be an Unit / Hero / Tower / Groot(Neutral Unit)
attackRange - the distance from which entities can attack
health - the current amount of damage they can take before they die
mana - the current amount of mana they have available to perform their skills
attack_damage - the amount of damage they can deal with an ATTACK command
movement_speed - the distance they can travel in a single turn. An entity will stop where it arrives and won't travel any further until the following round.

Entities also have maxHealth and maxMana. These represent the maximum values of health and mana they can have.

Towers are stationary. They do not move. Ever.

Attackingk

Heroes have an attack time of 0.1 and units have an attack time of 0.2

Ranged units require an additional attack time * distance / attackRange for their projectiles to hit the target.

A unit or hero is ranged if their attack attackRange is greater than 150.

If a unit is out of range, your hero will first move closer towards the target and then try to attack it. This helps a lot if you're only slightly out of range.

The time used to move is distance / moveSpeed

So if your hero has 75 range and travels a distance of 100 on the map, at 200 moveSpeed, it uses up 100 / 200 = 0.5 turn time and still has half the turn left to attack. The attack will take place at 0.5 + 0.1 since the hero is melee in this case.

The distance to the unit still needs to be equal or smaller to the hero's range for the attack to take place.

Attacks with an attack time higher than 1 don't carry over to the next round.

ATTACK_NEAREST unitType works like a regular attack command, except it attacks nearest entity of given type.
MOVE_ATTACK x y  unitId : your hero first moves to target location and then executes the attack, only if enough time is left during the current round to hit the target.


Last Hit & Deny

Any attack that takes away the last bit of health from an entity is called a Last Hit. A last hit performed on an enemy entity by one of your heroes grants you gold.

A last hit performed on one of your entities is called a Deny and prevents your opponent from getting gold when the entity dies. You can only attack an allied hero or allied unit when their health is below 40%.


Lane units aggro and attack pattern

If your hero attacks an enemy hero while his allied units are around him, these units will follow and attack your hero. This is called aggro. The attacking hero needs to be within 300 distance to the enemy units for this to take effect and it's canceled if the hero moves out of this range. Unit aggro lasts for 3 rounds, including the initial round.

Lane units will always first try to hit the hero that aggroed them.

If not aggroed, units move straight towards the enemy tower from their current location.
On their way they always stop to hit the closest unit from the enemy team, if the enemy is within attackRange.
- If multiple targets are at the same distance, the lowest health enemy is selected.
- Then the enemy with highest y coordinate in their location is selected.
- And last the enemy with lowest unitId is selected.


Tower aggro and attack pattern

The tower will attack in the following order:

First targets any enemy hero that attacks an allied hero.
Targets closest enemy unit within range.
Targets closest enemy hero.

Using spells or hitting the tower, doesn't force tower aggro.


Gold rewards

Entity Type	Gold Reward
Melee Unit	30
Ranged Unit	50
Hero	300
Denied Hero	150
Groot	100 - first spawn

Items

Items increase hero attributes when equipped. The amount of attributes and the bonuses vary from item to item. These attributes are added to the hero's current stats and are lost when the item is sold.

Possible item bonuses are health, maxHealth, mana, maxMana, manaRegeneration, attack_damage, moveSpeed.

When selling a mana boosting item your current mana will be minimum of 0 and currentmana - bonus mana granted by the item.

When selling a health boosting item your current health will be minimum of 1 and currenthealth - bonus health granted by the item.

Buying and Selling

A hero can purchase an item with the BUY item_name command.

A hero can sell an item with the SELL item_name command. 50% of the initial item gold value is refunded when selling an item.

Each hero can have up to 4 items at once. You can have multiple copies of the same item on a hero, but can only BUY and SELL one at a time.


Potions

Potions are items that get consumed immediately after purchase. Their values are permanently added to the hero. You can't sell them and they get removed from the hero's item slots, at the end of the round they are purchased. Your hero still needs an empty item slot to purchase a potion.

Potions can either recover current mana or current health. The bonus health and mana gained from potions won't go above maxHealth or maxMana.


Item Stats

All items will be generated at the start of the game with completely random stats.

Right at the beginning of the game you get a random amount of gold between 100 and 650. There will be items that are randomly generated to match this gold amount, so they’re affordable to players when the game starts.

All other items are generated to match different costs of all the game phases you go through, from early to late game.

What is in store for me in the higher leagues?

The extra rules available in higher leagues are:
Neutral creatures, bushes and a 2nd hero.
Hero skills.
Galaxies at War
The armored towers rose above the desolated area, stretching into the collapsing skies of two fusing pocket universes.

Droves of mighty raccoons broke the silence as they emerged from their strongholds where they had been lying in wait. Now relentlessly marching forward into the rocky desert, they sought to destroy the intruders.

The intruders were the ones who came to take down the dark armies and put a stop to their conquest.

When the boulder sized fist hit, it was hard and unforgiving. Their bodies were flung away, clearing the path. A skillful lance wielder was keeping them at bay, while the ground was scorched to seal them away.

Heroes had gathered!

“You know the plan, right?” asked Ironman.

“It's all about taking over the towers and control the bots so we can take over the galaxy.”

“No, it's not! We are here to save the galaxy from the raccoons!” exclaimed Valkyrie.

“Have you lost touch with ...” Reality? Doctor Strange was about to ask, but then a sudden realisation came to mind. They had been fighting alongside alternate versions of themselves from different universes. It was uncertain which reality came into question.

A heavy gaze turned inwards the group. Eyes widened, fists clenched and stares intensified.

“Justice will prevail,” growled Hulk.

“Hah, agreed. Whose justice though?” asked Deadpool.

“Fine, we each have a side to play on, so let's sort out things properly,” said the other Deadpool.

And there inbetween, within the twilight of the colliding bubble universes, they were battling. Each one of them fighting to uphold their own morals. As the worlds were falling apart they were trying to prove whose justice is true justice. To themselves and to the others, to the silent witnesses who could no longer stay silent …
